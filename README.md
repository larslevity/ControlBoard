The current version of the ControlBoard consists of eight modular continuous pressure channels and four directly switched pressure channels.
The control can be done either with the integrated potentiometers and push buttons, or by means of a separate computer on which the corresponding software is installed.
The heart of the ControlBoard is a BBB RevC. The corresponding software can be found <a href="https://github.com/larslevity/GeckoBot">here</a>.


## Main Components
The design of the board provides for the use of the following components. Other components can also be used, but the housing would have to be modified accordingly.

- 8x Festo MPYE 5/3 Proportional Valve
- 4x Norgren EXCEL 22 3/2 Valve
- 8x Honeywell SSC Pressure Sensor
- 1x BeagleBoneBlack Rev C
- 1x PULSe Dimension CPS Power Supply
